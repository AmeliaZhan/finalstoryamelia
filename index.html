      		<p>People who worry about employment often want to know the careers provide the most opportunity and openings. Students who are not in the workforce also wonder about the majors that will set them on the right career path and give them the best chances of getting employed.</p>

      		<p>The story will use data from 1990 to 2024 to compare employment of public sector and private sector, to compare specific economy sectors according to societal background and to discuss reason that makes a sudden drop of number for both public and private sector.</p>

      		<p>The line chart of past data shows that employments of public sectors and private sectors are both increasing throughout history from 1990 to 2024, but employment in public sector seems to be way more than those in private sector. Starting from 1990, public sector has employment of 9147 and private sector has employment of 6731. Public sector has 2416 more employment than private sector, which is a significant difference in number. When comparing the two sectors at a recent year of their peaks (2024), public sector has employment of 12508 and private sector of 8346, which still makes a difference of 4162. Overall, these comparisons show that public sector seems to have higher chance of employment throughout history in U.S. </p>

      		<p>“The Public Sector employs 20.2 million people in the U.S, approximately 14.5 percent of the workforce,” said Jonathan Brock, the executive director of the Secretory of Labor’s Task Force. This shows that Public Sector takes a large percentage in the employment of people in U.S. Brook also commented that “Application of information technology in private sector services have placed pressure on the public sector to provide better and faster services”. This shows that although public sector seems to have greater employment, private sector is still using it’s advantage to get an increase number of employment. It also shows that the number of employment in each sector is closely related to the sector’s characteristics and advantages.</p>

      			<iframe title="employment public sector vs. private sector" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-PMpHN" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PMpHN/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="395" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
        </script>
    		</div>

      		<p>The percentage change data in the bar chart shows 9 selected economy sectors in detail. Education seems to be the sector with greatest change. One finding from the data is that Arts, Entertainment and Recreation has larger percentage change of employment than Accommodation of food. “Arts, Entertainment and Recreation” sector has a 86.71% change and “Accommodation and Food” has 60.38”. “Accommodation and food” is usually seen as a more basic and fundamental need when compared to entertainment, but it seems like U.S. economy’s demand on entertainment is growing faster, probably because basic needs are already fulfilled by a large degree. This doesn’t mean that the economy is having less demand on Accommodation and Food, since float in Accommodation and Food is just more settled down and the changes are less sensitive to environment. </p>

      		<p>However, the growth of entertainment still wouldn’t go beyond the two public sectors that the society has continuously increasing demand of: “Education” and “Health Care and Social Assistance”. “Education” has 115.93% change and “Health Care and Social Assistance” has 112.71% change. This means that theses two essential sectors in the economy are demanding more workers and the demand is increasing at a higher speed comparing to sector of entertainment.</p>

     		<p>Another significant finding from the graph is that employment of public and private sectors both had a sudden fall in the year of 2020. It’s known that 2020 is the year of pandemic, which would be the major cause of drop in employment, as most organizations were laying off their employees to minimize cost in a time that they barely make any profit. From year 2019 to 2020, employment of public sector dropped from 12308 to 11246, which makes a decrease of 1062. Employment of private sector dropped from 8296 to 7370, which makes a difference of 926. </p>

      		<p>The drops show that economy’s demand on jobs is not only affected by the characteristics of economy sectors but also affected by environmental change. Luckily, both public and private economy sectors’ employment went back up after the pandemic period passes away over time. </p>
